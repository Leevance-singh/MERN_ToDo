MERN Stack Todo Application

This Todo application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) and offers a variety of powerful features to enhance user experience and functionality:

CRUD Operations: The app supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing users to add, view, edit, and remove their tasks seamlessly.

Task Organization: Each todo is categorized into three separate sections: Todo, In Progress, and Done, making it easy to track the status of each task.

Dynamic Progress Bar: Each todo item includes a dynamic progress bar, visually indicating the completion status of the task, allowing users to track progress at a glance.

Theme Support: The app offers both Dark Mode and Light Mode, with automatic theme adjustment based on the user's preferences.

Semi-Responsive Design: The app is designed to be semi-responsive, providing a smooth user experience across different screen sizes.

Future Enhancements: Upcoming features include full-stack authentication, personalized data tied to each userâ€™s unique ID, and more.

This application demonstrates the power of the MERN stack in creating a functional and interactive Todo app, with an eye on continuous improvement.
